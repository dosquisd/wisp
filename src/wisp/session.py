"""Lifecycle management for the currently active Wisp session.

Wisp creates billable cloud resources (a VM, a Pulumi stack, a local WireGuard
interface) and holds them open until it is told to stop. Historically nothing
released them on the way out, so any interruption left resources running and
costing money.

This module makes the teardown a *decision* of the session instead of a side
effect of a particular exit path:

- :class:`SessionGuard` runs the teardown exactly once, no matter how many
  triggers fire. Shutdown can be requested by a keybinding, a POSIX signal, an
  unmount, or an ``atexit`` hook, and all of them funnel into the same guard.
- :func:`write_active_session` / :func:`read_active_session` /
  :func:`clear_active_session` maintain a marker file on disk. Signals that
  cannot be caught (``SIGKILL``, a hard crash, losing power) still leave the
  marker behind, which is what lets :func:`find_orphaned_session` detect and
  clean up a previous run on the next startup.
- :func:`teardown_active_session` performs the actual release: bring the local
  WireGuard interface down, then destroy the cloud stack.

Platform notes: signal handling is POSIX-only. Windows has no ``SIGTERM``
delivery to arbitrary processes and shares console control events across the
process group, so :func:`install_signal_handlers` is a no-op there and teardown
is driven by keybindings, unmount, and ``atexit`` instead. Catching
``SIGKILL`` is impossible by design on every platform; the marker file is the
mitigation.
